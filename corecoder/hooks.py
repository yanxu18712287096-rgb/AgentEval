"""User shell hooks around tool calls, distilled from Claude Code's hooks.

Definitions live in ~/.corecoder/hooks.json:

    {"PreToolUse":  [{"matcher": "bash", "command": "..."}],
     "PostToolUse": [{"matcher": "*",    "command": "..."}]}

Each hook is a shell command fed the tool call as JSON on stdin. A pre hook
vetoes the call with exit code 2; its stderr goes back to the model as the
reason. Post hooks only observe. A hook that errors or hangs is skipped with
a warning: hooks assist the loop, they never get to kill it.
